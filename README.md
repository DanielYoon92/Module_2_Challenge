The code was edited to run faster. 
Previously, I used arrays to store the values and make the calculations. This was taking too long to display the results.
The code is now edited without using arrays.

Please see below for the screenshots of the results
2018_Result.PNG = Screenshot of the result
2019_Result.PNG = Screenshot of the result
2020_Result.PNG = Screenshot of the result
